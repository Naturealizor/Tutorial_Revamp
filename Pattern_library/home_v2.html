	<h2> Butler WebDevelopment Sandbox</h2>
	<p>Whether you've created a simple static website or developed a dynamic site using client-side webscritpting, a Content Management System, or custom server-side programming, understanding how to upload your work to a webserver and share it with the public is an important part of the web development process. Additionally, web developers must understand server configuration, behavioral deifferences in development and production environments, optimization techniques, and how to test accessibility, responsiveness, and site performance in the real world.</p>

	 <p><strong>There is no substitute for experience, period.</strong> This webserver sandbox provides a valuable learning experience for you as a Web Developement student. You may not be proud of everything you produce and you will likely make some embarrasing mistakes along the way, but you will gain extremely valuable &#8220;real world&#8221; experience on your journey. And that's a promise!</p>

	<p>We hope to automate account setup and support functions in the near future. Until then, the following information should help you get started.</p>

	<h3>How Do I Create My Account?</h3>
    <p>Free webserver accounts are provided <strong>only to currently enrolled Butler Community College Web Development students</strong>. Your instructor will provide your account details (your assigned subdomain, username, and initial password), demonstrate how to configure your cPanel and publish to your account, and answer your general questions, including how to request a password reset. Until there is an automated support system in place, please contact your instructor if you have any problems with your hosting account.</p>
